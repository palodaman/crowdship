                  <div class="faq-text">
                     <h5>1. How does pricing work?</h5>
                        <p class="lead">CrowdShip uses a transparent pricing model based on factors like distance, package size, and delivery urgency. Since drivers are already heading to the destination, our rates are often lower than traditional courier services. While you have the ability to set your own prices, CrowdShip recommends prices that are fair for both the driver and sender.</p>

                        <h5>How we calculate pricing:</h5>

                        <p><b>1. Basic fee — We have a minimum starting price of $5</b></p>

                        <p><b>2. Volume — Charges are based on package size</b></br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Small parcel (L x W x H < 10,000): $2</br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Medium parcel (10,000 ≤ L x W x H < 30,000): $5</br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Large parcel (30,000 ≤ L x W x H < 50,000): $10</br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Oversize (L x W x H ≥ 50,000): $20 + $10 oversize surcharge</br>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>3. Distance pricing — Charges are based on delivery distance</b></br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Within 20km: $0.15/km</br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Over 20km: $0.20/km</br>
                           <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Fixed Ferry Fee: $15 for inter-regional routes (e.g. Victoria to Vancouver).</br>
                        </p>

                        
                        <p><b>Example 1: Small parcel (L 30 cm x W 20 cm x H 15 cm = 9,000, delivery distance 10 km)</b></p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Volume Fee (small parcel): $2</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Distance Fee: 10 km x $0.15 = $1.50</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Total cost: $5 + $2 + $1.50 = $8.50</p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Total Cost: $5 + $5 + $5.00 = $15.00</p>

                     <h5>5. Are there any limitations on what I can send?</h5>
                     <p class="lead">For safety and compliance reasons, CrowdShip has guidelines on what can and cannot be sent. Items like hazardous materials, illegal substances, and oversized or extremely heavy packages are restricted. Feel free to reach out if you’re unsure about a specific item, we're more than happy to help!</p>

                     <h5>7. How do reviews and ratings work?</h5>
                     <p class="lead">After each delivery, both the sender and driver can leave a rating and review. These reviews are used by senders so that they know their package is in safe hands, and they're used by drivers to make informed decisions. They are also used by CrowdShip to vet drivers and keep the community safe.</p>

                     <p class="lead">Yes! CrowdShip offers both real-time and scheduled deliveries. You can select a pickup time that works best for you, allowing you to plan around your schedule and find a driver who can deliver within your preferred timeframe.</p>
