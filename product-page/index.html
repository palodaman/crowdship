Since drivers are already heading to the destination, our rates are often lower than traditional courier services. While you have the ability to set your own prices, CrowdShip recommends prices that are fair for both the driver and sender.</p>

                     <h5>7. How do reviews and ratings work?</h5>
                     <p class="lead">After each delivery, both the sender and driver can leave a rating and review. These reviews are used by senders so that they know their package is in safe hands, and they're used by drivers to make informed decisions. They are also used by CrowdShip to vet drivers and keep the community safe.</p>

                     <h5>8. How does CrowdShip minimize environmental impact?</h5>
                     <p class="lead">By connecting packages with drivers already on the road, CrowdShip reduces the need for additional delivery vehicles and excess emissions. We’re proud to offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional courier services, helping to lower the carbon footprint of each delivery.</p>

              <p class="testimonial-text">This app would be super useful for my small business. We often run out of items during the day and need to source replacements from Courtenay, the closest city. However, to reach Courtenay, you either need your own boat or have to take two ferries. Having a service like this would be so useful!</p>

Despite the high price, the cord never arrived because the shipping company couldn’t locate my remote address. Through CrowdShip, I could have had residents of the island deliver my cord and this problem would have been avoided. "</p>
